1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  	A remote repository can be helpful with respect to:
  	a. Sharing the code publicly. This [open source] method has the following advantages:
      i. A global community of programmers can enhance your code and improve the efficiency of your app;
      ii. Programmers can build on the same code for other interesting initiatives.
  	b. Sharing the code privately with other programmers in the project.

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with   your remote repository?
	To ensure that we commit only we retain only finished work. I'm not sure there is another reason.
