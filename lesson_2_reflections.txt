1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	A '.git' directory is created with no initial commits when you initialize
	a repository.

	You need to initialize a repository in order to create a '.git' directory
	that will store all the committed files.

2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
   What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area offers a container to batch files that need to be committed together.
