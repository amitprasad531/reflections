1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	A '.git' directory is created with no initial commits when you initialize
	a repository.

	You need to initialize a repository in order to create a '.git' directory
	that will store all the committed files.

2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
   What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area offers a container to batch files that need to be committed together. 

3. How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

	Since files that are linked to each other are stored in the staging area, any logical
	change will only require committing those files which are likely to be affected.
